# Avalanche-Victim-detection--Idea-Abstract
This idea involves a comprehensive approach to avalanche victim detection, combining visual data like contrast detection, motion detection, thermal imaging and signal devices like beacon and radar. 
historical data are used to train the models.
First, the direction of avalanche flow is detected and the zone to be inspected is narrowed down to a specific place.(Avalanche simulation analysis)
Next step, the real time Visual images and Signaling of the specific zones are obtained.
These visual and signal feeds are provided as inputs into respective separated models.
Then, the outcomes are fed into fusion model to predict and detect the victimâ€™s location.

Use cases:

This project has the potential to be used for accurate victim detection.
It serves as a time-efficient search for victim detection.
It has great significance in defence and security.
It has a great scope in the field of research related to predictions and warnings.
The data and algorithms can be reused for other environmental predictions.
These datasets can be made useful for specific-location risk analysis.
This model can be effectively used for multiple victim detection simultaneously.

Dependencies:
Relevant Data sources.
Machine learning models and programming languages .
Sensor Technology.

Stopper:
Limitation in data source availability.
Absence of real time access to satellite images hinders to enhance the accuracy.
