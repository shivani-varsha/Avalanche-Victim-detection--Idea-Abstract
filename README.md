# Avalanche-Victim-detection--Idea-Abstract
This idea involves a comprehensive approach to avalanche victim detection, combining visual data like contrast detection, motion detection, thermal imaging and signal devices like beacon and radar. 
historical data are used to train the models.
First, the direction of avalanche flow is detected and the zone to be inspected is narrowed down to a specific place.(Avalanche simulation analysis)
Next step, the real time Visual images and Signaling of the specific zones are obtained.
These visual and signal feeds are provided as inputs into respective separated models.
Then, the outcomes are fed into fusion model to predict and detect the victimâ€™s location.
